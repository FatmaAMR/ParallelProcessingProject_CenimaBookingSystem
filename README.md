# Cinema Booking System ðŸŽ¬

## Overview
The Cinema Booking System is a Python-based project designed to demonstrate the **practical applications of multithreading** in a real-world scenario. By comparing sequential and multithreaded operations for booking movie tickets, this project provides insights into the performance benefits and challenges of concurrent programming.

---

## Key Features
- **Core Focus**: Compare multithreaded and sequential ticket booking approaches.
- View a list of available movies and showtimes.
- Book tickets and observe real-time updates on seat availability.
- A GUI built with Tkinter for ease of interaction.
- SQLite database for persistent storage of movies and bookings.

## Why Multithreading?
This project aims to highlight:
1. The **performance benefits** of multithreading when handling concurrent bookings.
2. **Race conditions** and how they can affect database consistency.
3. **Comparison of execution times** between sequential and multithreaded booking processes.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **SQLite**: Database for movie and booking data.
- **Tkinter**: GUI for user interaction.
- **Multithreading Module**: For concurrent booking logic.
